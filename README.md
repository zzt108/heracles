# Heracles: Pleo's Test Engineer Challenge

We're really happy that you're considering to join us! Here's a challenge that will help us understand your skills and serve as a starting discussion point for the interview.

We're not expecting that everything will be done perfectly as we value your time. You're encouraged to point out possible improvements during the interview though!

## The challenge: Money Formatting

Given an amount of money as a number, format it as a string. Add associated tests for the functionality and for the user interface. 

```js
formatMoney(2310000.159897); // '2 310 000.16'
formatMoney(1600); // '1 600.00'
```

This needs to be a "fully working application" and you can choose the format:
- Web
- CLI
- Backend-Frontend
- Single-page-app
- Mobile app
- ...

eg: A simplesimple HTML page with an input box

### Our evaluation criteria:

- How did your structure your code? (eg: is it structured in a testable way?)
- What did you test?
- Which testing technique did you use? why?
- How did you test? (hint: we also care on how you will test the UI)
  - The functionality
  - The user interface
- We also care a little about the functionality itself

### What we won't really care: 

- If your UI looking great, 0 line of CSS is quite enough CSS
- You use the latest JS framework of the day
- The programming language

### What would be awesome:

- You use some nice testing techniques, fuzz testing, mutation testing, ... (even if they don't make sense here they'll probably do in your day to day job)
- You handle some stuff to test that we are not even aware of 
  - eg: You handle funky unicode strings (eg: [big list of naughty strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings))
- You show us how you run your tests in CI/CD
  
## Instructions:

Fork this repo with your solution. We want to see your progression through commits (don’t commit the entire solution in 1 step) and don't forget to create a README.md to explain your thought process.

Please let us know how long the challenge takes you. We're not looking for how speedy or lengthy you are. It's just really to give us a clearer idea of what you've produced in the time you decided to take. Feel free to go as big or as small as you want.

Happy testing! 🚀
